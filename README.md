# Search-Engine
Search engine from scratch 


# Goal
Search engine from scratch by using techniques such as text pre-processing, reverse indexing and cosine similarity.

In particular, the following step are performed:

-Crawling and parsing html's to build the set of documents
-Text pre-processing of the documents
-Reverse indexing
-Computation of the inverse term frequency and inverse document frequency (Tf-idf)
-Implementation of the Search Engine with the cosine similarity
